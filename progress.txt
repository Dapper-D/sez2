NSE Options Trading Analysis and Signal Generation - Project Analysis and Progress
====================================================================

1. **Project Overview**
----------------------
This project is a modular pipeline for collecting, storing, processing, and analyzing NSE options data, with the goal of generating trading signals using both technical indicators and machine learning. It features real-time and historical data ingestion, a PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB backend, technical indicator calculation, ML model training, and a Streamlit GUI for visualization and analysis.

2. **Step-by-Step Workflow**
---------------------------
**a. Database Schema Setup (`schema_design.py`)**
   - Connects to PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB.
   - Creates tables for instruments, candlesticks (1min, 15sec), technical indicators, and trading signals.
   - Converts tables to hypertables and sets retention policies.

**b. Historical Data Download (`historical_downloader.py`)**
   - Reads `Nifty_Input.csv` for instrument/date config.
   - Downloads historical options data and saves as CSVs in `historical_data/`.
   - Imports CSVs into the database.

**c. Real-time Data Collection (`data_collector.py`)**
   - Authenticates with NSE data vendor, downloads tickers, connects to WebSocket.
   - Subscribes to up to 70 tickers (NSE/BSE).
   - Aggregates tick data into 1min/15sec candles, stores in DB.

**d. Indicator Calculation (`indicator_calculator.py`)**
   - Loads 1min candles for each instrument.
   - Calculates indicators (OBV, RSI, TVI, PVI, PVT).
   - Stores results in `technical_indicators` table.

**e. Data Preparation (`data_preparation.py`)**
   - Prepares data for ML/LLM, including feature engineering and scaling.
   - Generates training/testing datasets, supports forward/live testing.
   - Trains RandomForestClassifier, saves model and results.

**f. Pipeline Validation (`pipeline_validator.py`)**
   - Validates schema, data flow, indicator completeness, and retention policies.
   - Generates validation reports.

**g. GUI (`app_gui.py`)**
   - Streamlit app for data exploration, charting, signal analysis, and forward/live test visualization.

3. **Log Analysis and Issues**
-----------------------------
- **data_collector.log & log.txt**
  - Data collection, authentication, and subscription are working.
  - Many instruments have "No data" for certain strikes/expiries (likely due to market inactivity or data vendor limitations).
  - All CSVs are saved and imported successfully.
  - WebSocket connection error: `module 'websocket' has no attribute 'WebSocketApp'` (likely missing or misconfigured websocket-client package).

- **data_preparation.log**
  - Initial warning: "No data available for forward test for instrument_id=55479" (data gap for this symbol).
  - Later runs succeed: forward test dataset created, model trained, accuracy reported (100% on small sample, 52.94% on another).
  - Live inference and feature engineering run successfully.

- **indicator_calculator.log & pipeline_validator.log**
  - No recent errors, but logs are empty (may indicate logging is not enabled or nothing ran recently).

- **log.txt**
  - PipelineValidator: Error validating retention policies: `relation "_timescaledb_config.bgw_policy_drop_chunks" does not exist` (TimescaleDB background policy table missing, may affect retention enforcement).
  - Warnings about missing 15-second candles and technical indicators for some periods (may be normal in test or due to data gaps).
  - Otherwise, all steps initialize and complete as expected.

4. **Improvements and Fixes Needed**
------------------------------------
- **WebSocket Connection Error**: Fix the import or installation of the `websocket-client` package. Ensure `WebSocketApp` is available and used correctly in `data_collector.py` to restore real-time data collection.
- **TimescaleDB Retention Policy**: Investigate TimescaleDB setup. The missing `_timescaledb_config.bgw_policy_drop_chunks` table suggests retention policies are not being enforced. Re-run TimescaleDB extension setup and ensure background jobs are enabled.
- **Data Gaps**: Many "No data" messages for certain instruments/strikes. This may be normal, but consider:
    - Improving error handling/logging to distinguish between expected and unexpected gaps.
    - Optionally, filter out instruments with no data from further processing to reduce noise.
- **Empty Logs**: The empty logs for `indicator_calculator.log` and `pipeline_validator.log` suggest logging may not be working or those scripts are not running as expected. Check logging configuration and ensure these modules are executed as part of the pipeline.
- **Forward Test Sample Size**: Forward test accuracy is reported on very small samples (17 rows). Consider increasing the sample size for more robust evaluation.
- **Documentation**: The Readme is comprehensive, but consider adding troubleshooting for common errors (websocket, TimescaleDB policies, data gaps) and clarifying known limitations.

5. **Summary**
--------------
- The project is well-structured and modular, with a clear data pipeline and GUI.
- Most components are working, but there are some issues with WebSocket connectivity, TimescaleDB retention, and data completeness for some instruments.
- Addressing the above issues will improve reliability and robustness.
